/**
 * `createQueryService` is the main entrypoint for Connect-Query.
 *
 * Pass in a service and you will receive an object with properties for each of your services and values that provide hooks for those services that you can then give to Tanstack Query.  The `ServiceType` TypeScript interface is provided by Protobuf-ES (`@bufbuild/protobuf`) while generated service definitions are provided by Connect-Web (`@connectrpc/connect-web`).
 *
 * `Transport` refers to the mechanism by which your client will make the actual network calls.  If you want to use a custom transport, you can optionally provide one with a call to `useTransport`, which Connect-Query exports.  Otherwise, the default transport from React context will be used.  This default transport is placed on React context by the `TransportProvider`. Whether you pass a custom transport or you use `TransportProvider`, in both cases you'll need to use one of `@connectrpc/connect-web`'s exports `createConnectTransport` or `createGrpcWebTransport`.
 *
 * Note that the most memory performant approach is to use the transport on React Context by using the `TransportProvider` because that provider is memoized by React, but also that any calls to `createQueryService` with the same service is cached by this function.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * export const { say } = createQueryService({
 *   service: {
 *     methods: {
 *       say: {
 *         name: "Say",
 *         kind: MethodKind.Unary,
 *         I: SayRequest,
 *         O: SayResponse,
 *       },
 *     },
 *     typeName: "connectrpc.eliza.v1.ElizaService",
 *   },
 * });
 *
 * const { data, isLoading, ...etc } = useQuery(say.useQuery());
