/**
 * TanStack Query requires query keys in order to decide when the query should automatically update.
 *
 * `QueryKey`s in TanStack Query are usually arbitrary, but Connect-Query uses the approach of creating a query key that begins with the least specific information: the service's `typeName`, followed by the method name, and ending with the most specific information to identify a particular request: the input message itself.
 *
 * For example, for a query key might look like this:
 *
 * @example
 * [
 *   "connectrpc.eliza.v1.ElizaService",
 *   "Say",
 *   { sentence: "hello there" },
 * ]
