# @connectrpc/connect-query-core

This package provides the core functionality for the Connect Query API. It exposes all the necessary functions to use with the different variants of the tanstack/query packages. Documentation for these APIs can be found in the main repo readme at https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-query-es and covers any non-hook functions (anything that doesn't start with `use`).
