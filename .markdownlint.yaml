# MD004 - Unordered list style
# We want to use dashes consistently everywhere
MD004:
  style: dash

# MD013 - Line length
# We do not want to artificially limit line length in a language like markdown because of the nature of the language's handling of whitespace.  Line wrapping is just a fact of life in markdown and trying to impose the conventions of other languages on markdown is an impedance mismatch that leads to people thinking that whitespace in markdown is more representative of the rendered HTML than it really is.
MD013: false

# MD025 - Multiple top-level headings in the same document
# Although this rule is great in spirit, the rendered on markdown for such a large root readme simply (visually) requires multiple `h1`s as to decrease one level of nesting so horizontal dividers are easier to see and headings are larger.
MD025: false

# MD033 - Inline HTML
MD033:
  allowed_elements:
    - details # there is no markdown equivalent for accordions
    - summary # there is no markdown equivalent for accordions
