## Updating dependencies

You can update all dependencies in this project with a single command:

```console
pnpm run update-all
```

This command is just a convenience wrapper around `pnpm update` and `pnpm outdated`.

If everything goes as planned, you should not see any output from the `pnpm outdated` command after the update is complete.
